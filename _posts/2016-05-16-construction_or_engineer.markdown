Coming out of highschool I was associated with doing nerdy things before nerdy things were cool. I fixed computers, built my own computer for "school", and played my fair share of games. I didn't put much thought in to what I wanted for my future let alone a career. I wanted to be a photographer as a kid but I didn't seem as interesting when the photography boom took place. 
I eventually fell in to engineering only because it was the next step for me logically speaking. To be more precise I focused on Computer Engineering with more emphasis on the software side of things. 
It was interesting. I wasn't the best engineer out of my peers but I enjoyed the mental challenge. My grades were average at best but I kept at it. I ended up enjoying working on software project that seemed relevant to real-world scenarios. Projects let me feel accomplished regardless of whether or not I was stumped for a project.
